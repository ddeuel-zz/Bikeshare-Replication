## The Paper
This is a replication of the **Impact of a public transit strike on public bicycle share use: An interrupted time series natural experiment study** a paper by Daniel Fuller et al. published in the June 2019 volume of the Journal of Transport & Health. The paper can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221414051830553X).

## The Data
From November 1-7th, 2016, Philadelphia's transit workers went on strike, stopping all transit services in the city.

This data covers bikeshare ride statistics over time around this strike in Philadelphia and other large cities to examine this strike as an interrupted time series natural experiment in how bikeshare usage changes when other transit options are limited. The data can be found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/745ZS3#).
