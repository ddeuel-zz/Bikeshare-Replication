## The Paper
This is a replication of the **Impact of a public transit strike on public bicycle share use: An interrupted time series natural experiment study** a paper by Daniel Fuller et al. published in the June 2019 volume of the Journal of Transport & Health. The paper can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221414051830553X). The authors claimed that the disruption in public transit services caused by Philadelphia's transit workers strike from November 1-7 led to a short term increase in bikeshare use when controlling for temperature, precipitation, and bikeshare use is similar cities during the same time. I successfully replicated Fuller's results. The models indicate that while the disruption to normal transit availability caused short term increase in bikehsare usage, usage returned to baseline within a short period. I extended the replication by handling missing data in a different way, creating a multiple change point time series, creating a new linear model and making predictions using that model to analyze the differences in bikeshare use from the three main time periods of the study.

## The Data
From November 1-7th, 2016, Philadelphia's transit workers went on strike, stopping all transit services in the city.

This data covers bikeshare ride statistics over time around this strike in Philadelphia and other large cities to examine this strike as an interrupted time series natural experiment in how bikeshare usage changes when other transit options are limited. The data can be found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/745ZS3#).
