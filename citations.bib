abstract = "Introduction
Promoting active transportation is an important public health objective. Limited research has examined the potential of interventions that highly constrain transportation and their potential impact on cycling. From November 1-7th, 2016, Philadelphia's transit workers went on strike, stopping all transit services in the city.
Methods
We used the strike event as a natural experiment to examine the impact of public transit strikes on use of Philadelphia's bicycle share program. We estimated the impact of the strike using two separate approaches, interrupted time series and Bayesian structural time series models. We estimated the impact of the intervention overall and stratified by membership type (members and non-members). Models controlled for the weather in Philadelphia (daily temperature and precipitation), and the rate of bicycle share use per 100,000 people in Washington, Boston, and Chicago.
Results
We estimate the strike caused an increase of between 86 and 92 trips per 100,000 population (57% increase in use) on average in Philadelphia during the strike period. After the strike ridership quickly returned to baseline, decreasing by 80 trips per 100,000 population after the strike. Similarly, members and non-member ridership increased by 41 and 49 trips per 100,000 population on average during the strike period and quickly returned to baseline, respectively.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that interventions that highly constrain transit can increase active transportation but the behavior may not be sustained after transit becomes available again."

abstract = "The recent proliferation of bike share schemes (BSS, also known as public bicycle use programs) in many cities has focused attention on their potential for reducing motorised traffic congestion, improving air quality and reducing car use. Since 2005, hundreds of bike share schemes have been implemented in many cities, with bike share usage patterns monitored in many of them. This paper assesses the development of BSS and provides a rationale for their potential health benefits. The key research question, as yet unanswered, is whether BSS themselves can contribute to improving population health, particularly through increasing population cycling, which would increase population levels of health-enhancing physical activity. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the contribution of BSS to population physical activity, and uses examples of new data analyses to indicate the challenges in answering this question. These illustrative analyses examine cycling in Australia, and [i] compares rates of cycling to work in BSS cities compared to the rest of Australia over time, and [ii] modelling trends in bike counts in Central Melbourne before and after introduction of the BSS in 2010, and compared to adjacent regions in nearby suburbs unexposed to a BSS. These indicative examples point to difficulties in attributing causal increases in cycling for transport to the introduction of a BSS alone. There is an evidence gap, and a need to identify opportunities to improve the health-related components of BSS evaluations, to answer the question whether they have any impact on population physical activity levels."

To investigate the immediate and sustained effects of two London Underground strikes on use of a public bicycle share program.
Methods
An interrupted time series design was used to examine the impact of two 24hour strikes on the total number of trips per day and mean trip duration per day on the London public bicycle share program. The strikes occurred on September 6th and October 4th 2010 and limited service on the London Underground.
Results
The mean total number of trips per day over the whole study period was 14,699 (SD=5390) while the mean trip duration was 18.5minutes (SD=3.7). Significant increases in daily trip count were observed following strike 1 (3864: 95% CI 125 to 7604) and strike 2 (11,293: 95% CI 5169 to 17,416).
Conclusions
Events that greatly constrain the primary motorised mode of transportation for a population may have unintended short-term effects on travel behaviour. These findings suggest that limiting transportation options may have the potential to increase population levels of physical activity by promoting the use of cycling."
